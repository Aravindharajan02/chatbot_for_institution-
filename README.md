# chatbot_for_institution-
In this modern world, we can see chatbots anywhere. But only some educational institution use chatbot so that's why i build a chatbot for institution.      
In this chatbot there some pre-defined keywords are given. if the user query matches with the Pre-defined keywords the response will be generated.
this is the working model of this chatbot.
First we need to train the chatbot, after that we run the chat.py file (works in terminal) or app.py file (opens new window).
we can start chatting with the chatbot.
